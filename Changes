	- switch internals to MooseX::MultiMethods
	- remove support for data URIs due to changes in
	  MooseX::Types::VariantTable that cause an ambiguous match (they can't
	  technically be a subtype of the URI type, since it isn't a ClassType but
	  a union of the class types URI and URI::WithBase)

0.02
	- improve handling of URIs

0.01
	- Initial release
